# 3D Personal portfolio

In this project, I utilized a technical stack that includes React.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, EmailJS, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Through this development experience, I gained valuable knowledge in Three.js for 3D rendering, learned how to effectively use React Three Fiber to create interactive 3D graphics within a React application, and utilized React Three Drei to simplify the integration of 3D components. Additionally, I implemented EmailJS for seamless email communication and used Vite for a fast development environment, all while styling the application with Tailwind CSS.
